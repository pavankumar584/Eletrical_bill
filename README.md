# Electricity Bill Calculator

This Python script calculates the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed by the user. 
It follows a slabwise tariff system with varying rates for different consumption ranges and a fixed charge for high consumption.

## Features

- User input for the number of units consumed
- Input validation to ensure positive numeric values
- Calculation of electricity bill based on the following slabs:
  - 1 to 100 units: ₹1.5 per unit
  - 101 to 200 units: ₹2.5 per unit
  - 201 to 300 units: ₹4 per unit
  - 301 to 350 units: ₹5 per unit
  - Above 350 units: Fixed charge of ₹1500
- Additional fixed charges based on the consumption slab
- Display of the total electricity bill amount

## Usage

1. Run the script
2. Enter the number of units consumed when prompted
3. The script will calculate and display the total electricity bill amount

This project serves as a coding exercise or example for implementing a tariff-based billing system in Python. 
It demonstrates the use of conditional statements, input validation, and formatted output.
